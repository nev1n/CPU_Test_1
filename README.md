Creating a Processor from scratch with multiple lego block like components/structures, for dependability and fault tolerance tests.
The idea behind lego block type structural components is to provide modularity and scalability for tests. Besides it is in VHDLs nature to be explicitly specific and suits the lego block type structres.
Will try to base it as much as on the RISC V ISA.
